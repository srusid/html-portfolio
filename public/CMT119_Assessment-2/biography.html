            A BIOGRAPHY OF FIRST COMPUTER PROGRAMMER </h1>

            <p> “Ada is connected to two great geniuses, the daughter of the Romantic poet, Lord Byron, and a friend of the mathematician and scientist, Charles Babbage. Her name has been a trademark of the United States Department of Defense, and when they developed a computer language, it was named “Ada” in her honour” (Betty 1992, p. 1). According to Betty (1992, p. 1), Ada described the greatest accomplishment of Babbage, the Analytical Engine, which is an important milestone that is considered the birth of the computer revolution.</p>

        <p class = "adaMaths"> As Betty stated (1992, p. 87), Ada felt that mathematics is crucial; she wanted to excel in mathematical and scientific concepts with a tactile approach by using models of geometric figures than restricting her interest to just solving formulas. This approach of computer simulations of models is in use to understand science to date.<br><br>
            “Ada described her way of learning as “peculiar” ” (Betty 1992, p. 116). As cited in Betty (1992, p. 116), Ada decided to continue her interest in mathematics after four years of marriage. She has written a winning strategy for a game in mathematical terms as she believed that the scope of mathematics is not limited to formulas and can be extended to the game field. “A pamphlet entitled <i>The Mathematical Analysis of Logic</i>” (Betty 1992, p. 116) is the foundation for software programmers to code games even today.<br>

        <p class = "adaNotes"> Betty (1992, pp. 195-196) mentioned that Ada had shown interest in the details of the Analytical Engine by asking relevant questions regularly. And she selected the Bernoulli numbers mathematical model to showcase the difference from Babbage’s first calculating engine, the Difference Engine, in her notes. Ada was keen on understanding the complete picture of the Analytical Engine, which resulted in developing a metaphysical understanding, and she started to understand the capable operations of the Analytical Engine.<br><br>
            "She integrated what we now refer to as digital or scientific skills of reason and analysis, from verbal to numerical, with the poetical skills of imagination, metaphor and the selection of appropriate illustrations” (Betty 1992, p. 240). According to Betty (1992, p. 240), Ada appropriately narrated Analytical Engine’s concept; and its design in her notes with her deep understanding, though the concept and design has come from Charles Babbage. Ada’s vision on language of science is thought-provoking with her interest and belief in magical expressions that mathematical language is capable of. She has successfully showcased it with detailed notes on Analytical Engine and the extension of the language to the gaming industry. Ada foreshadowed the capability of the modern computer over 160 years back and how it can impact the development of science in future generations.
