        <h2 class = "h2intro">What is Computational Thinking?</h2>
        <p class = "CTintro">According to Susan and Chris (2018), computational thinking is an approach to come up with solutions using computer science concepts that helps in solving problems on a computer. It is a process of multiple steps that include breaking down a complex problem into smaller parts, identifying the similarities in sub parts, and plan an increment solution based on the necessary information available. Computational thinking methodology is implemented by diverse professionals in multiple fields like business, medicine, education, life sciences, social sciences to solve real-world problems and not just restricted to computer scientists.

            <hr/>
            According to Susan and Chris (2018), <em><strong>decomposition</strong></em> is the process of taking a complex problem and breaking it into more manageable sub-problems. It is crucial task in computational thinking as real world problems; do not have a solution straight away. Hence, solving each sub-problem and combining those solutions together; helps solve the original complex problem. 
            <br><br>
            For example, my dream is to start travel business using either bike or legs. By applying decomposition concept, I have to break-down this final goal into smaller pieces like developing a software/webpage, identifying the right set of customers and tourist places, recruit the team to keep the business running, and many more. Then work on each individual tasks that leads to fulfilling my dream company.<br><br>
            <hr/>
            According to Susan and Chris (2018), when we decompose the problem, we frequently find patterns among the sub-problems. Discovering these similarities or shared characteristics within or between problems is called <em><strong>pattern recognition</strong></em>. This allows us to use the same solution for each occurrence of the pattern.
            <br><br>
            In the above-stated example, I need to identify customers for trekking and biking tours. Also, I need to develop a webpage and an application for both touring options. The tour options might be different, but the approach to solving these tasks in my business plan could be similar, which helps in saving time and effort in re-planning or re-doing things that aim for a common goal. <br> <br>
            <hr/>
            According to Susan and Chris (2018), <em><strong>data representation and abstraction </strong></em>involve determining the critical characteristics of the problem, followed by creating a presentation of the problem to be solved. Unimportant parameters can be filtered out and ignored.
            <br><br>
            In the above-stated example, I need not focus on explaining what is hiking or biking on my webpage/application. I should be working towards attracting more customers by showcasing how the trips are organised. As everyone who goes hiking and biking knows its meaning, it is not a critical parameter towards my business plan.<br><br>
            <hr/>
            According to Susan and Chris (2018), an <em><strong>algorithm</strong></em> 
            <br><br>
            In the above-stated example, to develop my business webpage or application, I need to start designing the layout of my website. Then, update the content of the website, and formatting it for an attractive appearance are a few of the tasks which need to be instructed in the programming language for the computer to understand and provide the output. This entire process of writing the order of instructions/code is known as algorithm.<br><br>
            <hr/>
            There are a couple more concepts that are crucial in computational thinking: <strong><em>Evaluation & Generalisation</em></strong><br><br>
            <em><strong>Evaluation</strong></em> is the process of ensuring an algorithmic solution as it fits the purpose. Evaluation of all properties of algorithms is needed to check its efficiency for good user experience. Trade-offs are needed as there is rarely a single ideal solution for all situations (Teaching London Company [no date]).<br>
            In the above-stated example, the code should be correct and efficient if many people browse, it should load the page quickly with a minimum internet connection, and it should be easy for people to update their forms to enrol for a trip etc.,. My team should evaluate the code thoroughly to meet all these requirements on my website.<br><br>
            <em><strong>Generalisation</strong></em>  is a quick way to solve new problems based on previous solved problems. We can take an algorithm that solves a particular problem and adapt it for similar problems. This solution works like a general solution for all similar problems (Teaching London Company [no date]).<br>
            In the above-stated example, I need to develop and maintain an application and a webpage for my business that requires a software engineers team. I would need to get software licenses enabled for the team to work. These are similar needs to develop a webpage and an application as well. Hence, I can apply the techniques/approach used for one platform on the other.<br> <br>

        <p  class = "CTdetails">
            Computational thinking is a prime subject, as I aspire to be a software engineer. This approach helps me break down the major problem at work, work in teams on a specific sub-problem by identifying critical aspects, and provide an effective solution through a programming language code. Also, this knowledge helps me to fulfil my dream travel company. As this is the foundation concept to tackle any problem, moving forward in my master's, it helps me in every assessment related to the course and even my dissertation.<br> <br>
