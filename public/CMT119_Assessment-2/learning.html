            CMT-119: Computational thinking is the first module in my MSc Computing course. It started with mixed feelings, excitement and nervousness as I did not have any background in Computing. But then, I realised that I was not alone here and would be alright.            
            <br><br>
            I started the learning with an introduction to the Internet/HTML/CSS provided at the learning central. The first day of the lecture was overwhelming as I had been using the internet for more than a decade, and I never knew that there were many terms related to it. For example, ARPANET, NAT, DNS, W3C etc., The bingo game conducted in the class was quite interactive and a great learning opportunity to hear from classmates and the professor. On the same day, I learnt the concept of computational thinking, which included sub-topics like decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, algorithm, generalisation and evaluation. The importance of techniques like binary search and parallel processing saves time in working on a few problem scenarios and understanding the criticality of logic, and techniques to solve a problem.             
            <br><br>
            The first exercise of this module, to create a web page, was exciting as I worked on my dream travel company website. It helped to initiate the first step of actually working towards my goal. In parallel, the session on number systems and data representation was refreshing as these are the foundation to start learning a programming language. Exercise solved in groups helped in making friends. Deep dive into CSS gave a learning opportunity on how fancy, attractive the web page can be created using CSS styles. The group activity of creating university webpage was a challenge to perform better than other groups, and the research made in the class room; to perform particular task was a mini hackathon project experience. We did not replicate it, but as a team we did our best and thats the fun working with a group. The additional resource recommendations like mozilla developer network, stack over flow helped me to deep dive few more concepts, apply them on this assessment.

        <h2 class = "h2learn">Impact of above learnings on the rest of the course:</h2>

        <p class = "learn">
            Computational thinking concepts are fundamental; solving any problem helps throughout my course and future career in the computer science stream. The knowledge of HTML/CSS helps to build a career as a web developer. To continue the learning on web development, JavaScript introduction in a different module adds value to my CV. Python is another programming language that I'm exploring this semester. To use all these languages and code on the computer, the basic concepts of computational thinking play a vital role in tackling any problem. The group activities in the classroom helped to familiarise the environment to work in groups both in the remaining coursework and future career. I'm also stuck at multiple points while dealing with exercises/assessments; it is alright to get stuck, and learning to seek help takes me a long way in upcoming coursework. The entire knowledge plays a prime role in my dissertation as problem-solving technique and webpage development will be part of it.            <br><br>
